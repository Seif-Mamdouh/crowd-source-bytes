### How to Build a Byte

Creating a new Byte is simple: 
- Create a new Rust project
    - `cargo new <name>`
    - `cd <name>`
    - And start writing Rust code!

- Make Pull Request
    - Add your code

That's it! The world is your oyster! 🌍

## Example Bytes

Here are some ideas to get you started. Each Byte is designed to be a small, self-contained project that is easy to understand and work with:

- Rusty Maze: A text-based maze solver 🧭
- Ferris' Flight: A side-scrolling adventure ✈️
- Oxidized: A logic puzzle game 🧩

## Making a PR

When submitting a Pull Request for your Byte:

1. Provide a clear description of what your Byte does 📝
2. Include steps to run it locally 🏃‍♂️
3. Leave comments in the diff indicating where you want the "bug" to be 🐞

Remember, the goal is to create fun, educational challenges for the Rust community! 🎓
