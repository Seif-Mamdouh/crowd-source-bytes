# Open Source Bytes: Rust Games

Welcome to Open Source Bytes, a collection of fun and educational Rust games!

## About

Bytes are games designed for pure Rust development entertainment! We're contributing to the Rust community by creating engaging, code-based challenges. We love Rust and want everyone else to learn. What better way to learn than by reading code and guessing what bugs there are?

## Contribute

We want you to contribute your own Bytes to make the Rust challenges even more fun! Be creative! Build whatever you want! Just make sure you follow these rules:

1. Be unique
2. Code must compile!

## How to Build a Byte

Creating a new Byte is simple:That's it! The world is your oyster!

## Example Bytes

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Rusty Maze: A text-based maze solver
- Crab Catcher: A simple fishing game
- Ferris' Flight: A side-scrolling adventure
- Oxidized Puzzler: A logic puzzle game
- Rust Belt: A resource management simulation

## Making a PR

When submitting a Pull Request for your Byte:

1. Provide a clear description of what your Byte does
2. Include steps to run it locally
3. Leave comments in the diff indicating where you want the "bug" to be

Remember, the goal is to create fun, educational challenges for the Rust community!
