# Open Source Bytes: Rust Games 🎮

Welcome to Open Source Bytes, a collection of fun and educational Rust games! 🦀

Play the Bytes on [here](https://coreyja.com/bytes)!

#### 📚TL:DR
- Bytes are Rust coding games designed for pure Rust learning! 🚀
- We love Rust and want everyone else to learn. What better way to learn than by reading Rust code and guessing what bugs there are? 🐛
- We want you to contribute your own Bytes to make the Rust challenges even more fun! 🤝 Be creative!

## 🤝 Contribute

Build small Rust CLI projects! Just make sure you follow these rules:

1. Be unique 🌟
2. Code must compile! ✅
3. Add Tests to your code 🧪

## 💡 Example Bytes

Here are some ideas to get you started. Each Byte is designed to be a small, self-contained project that is easy to understand and work with:

- Banking System: Manage accounts, transactions, balances and interest rates.
- AI Coffee Shop: Utilize LLM that can take customer orders through the CLI.
- Weather Forecasting: Input location and get a simulated weather forecast.


### 🚀 Getting Started

If you have an idea for a new Byte and want to discuss it before writing code, you can start by opening an issue:

1. **Open an Issue for Brainstorming**  
   - Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/coreyja/crowd-source-bytes/issues) tab.
   - Click on **New Issue** and select the **Brainstorming** label.
   - Describe your idea in detail to allow others to provide feedback and suggestions.
   - see an example of a brainstorming issue [here](https://github.com/coreyja/crowd-source-bytes/issues/2)

2. **Collaborate and Refine**  
   - Engage with the community by responding to comments.
   - Refine your idea based on the feedback received.

3. **Proceed to Implementation**  
   - Once your idea is well-defined, follow the steps below to build your Byte.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Build a Byte

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository: https://github.com/coreyja/crowd-source-bytes
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crowd-source-bytes.git
   cd crowd-source-bytes
   ```
3. Create a new branch with the following branch name style:
   ```
   git checkout -b <your-name>/main/<name-of-byte>-byte
   ```

### Create a New Rust Project

1. Create a new Rust project for your byte:
   ```
   cargo new <name-of-your-byte>
   ```
2. Navigate to your new byte project:
   ```
   cd <name-of-your-byte>
   ```
3. Open `src/main.rs` and write your code for your byte.

## Prepare Your Contribution

### Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add <name-of-your-byte> Byte"
   ```
2. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin <your-name>/main/<name-of-byte>-byte
   ```
3. Write a description of your Byte and instructions on how to run it locally.
4. Add test cases to the `tests/` directory.
5. Create a test plan for your Byte, including:
   - A description of the test plan
   - Expected output
6. Leave comments in the diff indicating where you want the "bug" to be 🐞
