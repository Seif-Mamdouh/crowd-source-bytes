# Open Source Bytes: Rust Games 🎮

Welcome to Open Source Bytes, a collection of fun and educational Rust games! 🦀

Play the Bytes on [here](https://coreyja.com/bytes)!

#### 📚TL:DR
- Bytes are Rust coding games designed for pure Rust learning! 🚀
- We love Rust and want everyone else to learn. What better way to learn than by reading Rust code and guessing what bugs there are? 🐛
- We want you to contribute your own Bytes to make the Rust challenges even more fun! 🤝 Be creative!

## 🤝 Contribute

Build small Rust CLI projects! Just make sure you follow these rules:

1. Be unique 🌟
2. Code must compile! ✅
3. Add Tests to your code 🧪


### 🚀 Getting Started

If you have an idea for a new Byte and want to discuss it before writing code, you can start by opening an issue:

1. **Open an Issue for Brainstorming**  
   - Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/coreyja/crowd-source-bytes/issues) tab.
   - Click on **New Issue** and select the **Brainstorming** label.
   - Describe your idea in detail to allow others to provide feedback and suggestions.
   - see an example of a brainstorming issue [here](https://github.com/coreyja/crowd-source-bytes/issues/2)

2. **Collaborate and Refine**  
   - Engage with the community by responding to comments.
   - Refine your idea based on the feedback received.

3. **Proceed to Implementation**  
   - Once your idea is well-defined, follow the steps below to build your Byte.

### 🧑‍💻 How to Build a Byte

Creating a new Byte is simple: 

- Create a new Rust project
    - `cargo new <name of your project>`
    - `cd <name of your project>`
    - navigate to `src/main.rs`
    - write your code!

- Make a Pull Request
    - Add your code
    - Write a description of your Byte and how to run it locally
    - Add test cases to the `tests/` directory
    - Add a test plan for your Byte
        - description of the test plan
        - expected output
    - Leave comments in the diff indicating where you want the "bug" to be 🐞

## 💡 Example Bytes

Here are some ideas to get you started. Each Byte is designed to be a small, self-contained project that is easy to understand and work with:

- Banking System: Manage accounts, transactions, balances and interest rates.
- AI Coffee Shop: Utilize LLM that can take customer orders through the CLI.
- Weather Forecasting: Input location and get a simulated weather forecast.


## 🧪 Making a PR

When submitting a Pull Request for your Byte:

1. Provide a clear description of what your Byte does 📝
2. Include steps to run it locally 🏃‍♂️
3. Leave comments in the diff indicating where you want the "bug" to be 🐞

Remember, the goal is to create fun, educational challenges for the Rust community! 🎓
